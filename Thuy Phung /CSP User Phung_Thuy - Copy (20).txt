Original Code

def main():
    number_of_times = int(input("Choose the number of times you want to spam. "))
    message = input("What message do you want to spam? ")
    for _ in range(number_of_times):
        print(message)

Commented Code

def main(): #defining the keyword "main" in order to run the program.
    number_of_times = int(input("Choose the number of times you want to spam. ")) #double parenthesis is passing the tuple as a single argument
#number_of_times = the underscores are there to name a loop variable that won't be referring to any variable. It just makes it easier for us to read what sort of function it is.
#int(input. int means integer and is needed to read the user's int input (whatever int they type) in order to spam the message as many times as the user wants to. 
#the ("") is a print function that is used whenever the program is asking the user something. 
    message = input("What message do you want to spam? ") #message is the name of the variable, same rule applies in line 2. The input allows the user to input any message they wish to spam.
#The ("") is the same function as line 2; however, when the user types a message they must use quotes in order for the program to print the message.
    for _ in range(number_of_times): #this line of code makes sure that the number of times repeated does not go over the amount the user inputted in line 2.
        print(message) #used print function to print the message
#This is an iterative process that repeats the same function for the given number of times the user wishes
